# FriendFeed

The beginnings of a Rails-based social website inspired by Facebook including the familiar concepts of 'liking', 'friending', and a news feed. You can  also sign up and sign in using an existing Facebook account.

## Access

FriendFeed is available [here](https://friend-feed.herokuapp.com/) and can be accessed by creating a new account or signing in with an existing Facebook account.

## Features
